The Chicken And Egg Machine, a SoFIE application

Game Play.
  Basic idea: lay as many eggs as you can before (a) you run out of chickens or (b) you lose all your health.

Lay an egg: The chicken (technically a hen) has to eat enough scratch and drink enough water to lay an egg. Th chicken autonomously eats and drinks, much like a real chicken does. You have to make sure there is enough scratch in the feed sack and enough water in the water bottle. If either of these runs out, the chicken dies (turns into a can of soup) and the game is over.

Direct the egg: When the egg is laid, you have to direct it to the fry pan, the egg crate or the nest.
  The fry pan can have at most two eggs at a time.
  The egg crate can carry up to 12 eggs.
  The nest can have at most 1 egg at a time.

To maintain your health, you must eat a fried egg whenever your health level drops below 50%. If you let your health drop to 0, you die and the game ends.

To get more scratch, you fill the egg crate with a dozen eggs. A full egg crate is automatically converted into a full feed sack.

Whever the water bottle level falls below 1 litre, you can refill it. Click on the tap to fill the bottle to capacity.

A chicken (technically a hen) can lay at most 36 eggs. You can drop an egg in the nest and hatch a new chicken which will replace the old chicken. In this way you can keep laying eggs pretty much forever.

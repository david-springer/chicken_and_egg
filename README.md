The Chicken And Egg Machine, a SoFIE Studios application

Game Play.
  Basic idea: stay alive as long as you can. You can't win this game. You can only not lose it.

Lay an egg: The chicken (technically a hen) has to eat enough scratch and drink enough water to lay an egg. The hen autonomously eats and drinks, much like a real hen does. You have to make sure there is enough scratch in the feed sack and enough water in the water bottle. If either of these runs out, the hen stops laying eggs and eventually dies.

Direct the egg: When the egg is laid, you have to direct it to the frying pan, the egg crate or the nest.
  The frying pan can have at most two eggs at a time.
  The egg crate can carry up to 12 eggs.
  The nest can have at most 1 egg at a time.

To maintain your health, you must eat a fried egg whenever your health level drops below 50%. If you let your health drop to 0, you die and the game ends.

To get more scratch, you fill the egg crate with a dozen eggs. You might think of it this way: you barter a dozen eggs for a sack of feed.

Whever the water bottle level falls below 1 litre, you can refill it. Click on the tap to fill the bottle to capacity. The incoming water supply is endless and free. Another place where this game departs from reality.

A hen can lay at most 20 eggs. You can drop an egg in the nest and hatch a new pullet which will replace the old hen when the old hen has laid all her eggs. In this way you can keep laying eggs pretty much forever. Note that each pullet also eats and drinks, so the rate that your feed and water is consumed goes up with each pullet you hatch.

TODO
====
  Add pullets and pullet feed/water consumption.
  Fix up egg frying graphics. Need a more obvious timing sequence.
  Add farmer graphics.
  Add dead hen graphics (a roasted chicken? a can of soup?).
  Add sound.
